## 🤔 How to add?

If you want to use Jujuba on your server, you can add our public instance by [clicking here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=970134090152034354&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot)! We recommend using the public instance.

You can also host Jujuba yourself, however we won't give support for people that are trying to selfhost her, we don't want to spend hours trying to troubleshoot other people issues that only happens on selfhosted instances, so you should at least know how to troubleshoot issues, if you find any.

### ⚙️ Configure .env

```bash
COLOR=You Color Here
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Starting Logger's
* Run Logger's With: `node .` 
* Check the console to see if there are any errors... Well, we hope that there are none. :3
* If you haven't, add your bot to a Discord server.
* After booting up, try using `/jujuba` on your Discord server.
* If everything went well, your very own Jujuba instance should be up and running! Congratulations! 🎉
